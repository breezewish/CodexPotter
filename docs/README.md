# Code Wiki

This `docs/` directory is developer-facing documentation ("code wiki") for the `codex-potter`
codebase.

It is intentionally **not** an end-user guide. Pages should focus on architecture, internal flows,
design decisions, conventions, and upstream-vs-fork ownership boundaries.

Start here: `docs/wiki/README.md`.
